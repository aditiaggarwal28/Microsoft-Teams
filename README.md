Troubleshooting
====================
1. If you are facing any issue in having a successful videocall, try using the app in Incognito mode of your browser. This may resolve some security issue which aren't allowing app to open.

2. If the issue is still not resolved, (for eg- your friend is not able to connect to your server), it might be because of the firewall in your/his Wifi connection.

3. If still facing the issues, this means your browser is blocking third party cookies, try using other browsers like edge, firefox.

4. If still facing the issue, reload the app once and don't reload while using it and fill all the information correctly.
